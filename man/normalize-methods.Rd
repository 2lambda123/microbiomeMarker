\item{method}{the methods used to normalize the microbial abundance data.
Options includes:
\itemize{
\item "none": do not normalize.
\item "rarefy": random subsampling counts to the smallest library size in the
data set.
\item "TSS": total sum scaling, also referred to as "relative abundance", the
abundances were normalized by dividing the corresponding sample library
size.
\item "TMM": trimmed mean of m-values. First, a sample is chosen as reference.
The scaling factor is then derived using a weighted trimmed mean over the
differences of the log-transformed gene-count fold-change between the
sample and the reference.
\item "RLE", relative log expression, RLE uses a pseudo-reference calculated
using the geometric mean of the gene-specific abundances over all
samples. The scaling factors are then calculated as the median of the
gene counts ratios between the samples and the reference.
\item "CSS": cumulative sum scaling, calculates scaling factors as the
cumulative sum of gene abundances up to a data-derived threshold.
\item "CLR": centered log-ratio normalization.
